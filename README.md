# STAR WARS TABLE


Imagine you are bingewatching a movie and the movie has 3 parts. Wouldn't it be too much to remember all the character names? You know what would be more difficult? Binge Watching a movie which has more than 6 parts ðŸ˜† and the worst part about that is? ALL THE CHARACTERS ARE RELATED SOMEHOW! And also the movie doesn't have a proper sequence in which we can watch it(It is still Disputed). You might have guessed the movie by now. It's STARWARS!

2. We can Search the elements in the Search Bar which will show us the result as a row in the table.  
3. It shows the loading state while the request is processing.
4. Display the current search query in the search input
5. Once we clear the search input we can see the first page again.
